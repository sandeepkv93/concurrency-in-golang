# Concurrent Backup Utility

## Problem Description

Creating efficient backup solutions requires handling multiple files concurrently while maintaining data integrity. The challenge is to:

1. Process multiple files in parallel for faster backup operations
2. Implement compression to reduce backup size
3. Generate checksums for data integrity verification
4. Handle file filtering and exclusion patterns
5. Provide progress tracking and error handling
6. Support both full and incremental backups

## Solution Approach

This implementation provides a comprehensive concurrent backup utility with the following features:

### Key Components

1. **Worker Pool**: Manages multiple concurrent backup workers
2. **File Processing Pipeline**: Stages for scanning, filtering, and processing files
3. **Compression**: Gzip compression with configurable levels
4. **Checksum Generation**: MD5 and SHA256 checksums for integrity verification
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error management with retry mechanisms

### Architecture

- **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: File scanner produces jobs, workers consume and process them
- **Pipeline Processing**: Multi-stage processing with different worker types
- **Atomic Operations**: Thread-safe counters and statistics
- **Channel-based Communication**: Coordination between goroutines

### Implementation Details

- **Concurrent File Scanning**: Directory traversal using worker pools
- **Pattern Matching**: Include/exclude patterns for file filtering
- **Compression Levels**: Configurable compression from 1-9
- **Checksum Verification**: Multiple hash algorithms for data integrity
- **Incremental Backups**: Support for differential and incremental strategies
- **Recovery Operations**: Backup verification and restoration capabilities

## Usage Example

```go
config := BackupConfig{
    NumWorkers:       4,
    CompressionLevel: 6,
    EnableChecksum:   true,
    ExcludePatterns:  []string{"*.tmp", "*.log"},
    MaxFileSize:      100 * 1024 * 1024, // 100MB
}

utility := NewBackupUtility(config)

job := &BackupJob{
    ID:              "backup_2024_01",
    SourcePaths:     []string{"/home/user/documents"},
    DestinationPath: "/backups/documents.tar.gz",
    Config:          config,
}

progress := make(chan BackupProgress, 100)
go utility.BackupWithProgress(job, progress)

// Monitor progress
for p := range progress {
    fmt.Printf("Progress: %d%% - %s\n", p.Percentage, p.CurrentFile)
}
```

## Technical Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple workers process files concurrently
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming compression without loading entire files
- **Configurable Compression**: Adjustable compression levels and algorithms
- **Integrity Checking**: Multiple checksum algorithms (MD5, SHA256)
- **Pattern Filtering**: Flexible include/exclude patterns
- **Progress Reporting**: Real-time progress tracking
- **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- **Incremental Backups**: Support for differential backup strategies
- **Verification**: Backup integrity verification and restoration testing

## Advanced Features

- **Concurrent Extraction**: Multi-threaded archive extraction
- **Checksum Verification**: Integrity verification during extraction
- **Metadata Preservation**: File permissions and timestamps
- **Compression Statistics**: Detailed compression ratios and timing
- **Resource Management**: Configurable memory and CPU usage limits

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Concurrent backup operations
